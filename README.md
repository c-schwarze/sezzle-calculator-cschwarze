# sezzle-calculator-cschwarze
 My web calculator for Sezzle.
 
Features
* You can type equations or use the visual calculator
* You can create functions that have multiple operators!
* Error handling for bad data
* Enter key process equation
 
Current limitations:
* Due to this being hosted on Heroku, its possible the log file will clear itself out occasionally.
* This is only a temporary hosting solution
* The log file only is reduced Heroku automaticallly clears this out on a restart.
* Due to using the JS function "setInterval", its a bit laggy. With more time, I would have explored a plugin to handle this issue.
